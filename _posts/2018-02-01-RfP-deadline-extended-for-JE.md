title: RfP deadline extended for Japanese encephalitis - closing date 7 February 2018
---

The Consortium is looking for models to estimate the global burden of Japanese encephalitis. The original request for proposals can be found [here](https://www.vaccineimpact.org/2017-12-19-request-for-proposals-yellow-fever-rubella-Japanese-encephalitis-closing-date-January-30/).    
The RfP for yellow fever and rubella models has now been closed. We thank all the interested candidates for their applications.

The new closing date for Japanese encephalitis models is 7 February 2018. The requirements remain the same as for the original RfP.
